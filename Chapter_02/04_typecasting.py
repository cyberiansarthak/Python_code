#TYPE CASTING IS A WAY TO CONVERT ONE DATA TYPE TO ANOTHER DATA TYPE IF POSIABLE

#Example01
A = "14556" # A variable now conatains string in it
A = int(A) # we convert it to integer
A+=45
print(A)
#Example02
B = "4566jkhjxs"  # B variable now conatains string in it
B = float(B)# we convert it to integer
B+=45
print(B)
# it is showing error on run because B contains string+int which can not covert to int
